# 🚀 Deploy to Vercel RIGHT NOW

## ⚡ 3 Commands to Deploy

\`\`\`bash
# 1. Login to Vercel
vercel login

# 2. Navigate to project
cd /Users/akbarchranya/georgiadashboard/gadash108/vercel-deploy

# 3. Deploy!
vercel --prod
\`\`\`

That's it! Your dashboard will be live in ~60 seconds.

## 🧪 Test It

After deployment, Vercel will give you a URL like:
\`https://georgia-dashboard-xxx.vercel.app\`

Visit these pages:
- \`/\` - Landing page
- \`/test.html\` - Infrastructure tests (4 automated tests)
- \`/dashboard.html\` - Executive dashboard (needs DB)

## ✅ What Will Work Immediately

- ✅ Static pages (landing, test)
- ✅ API test endpoint (\`/api/test\`)
- ⏳ Dashboard & database (need to setup connectivity)

## 🔌 Database Setup (Later)

The test page will show which parts need database access. 
We can set that up after you verify the deployment works!
